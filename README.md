This script exploits a vulnerability to manipulate ELO values by injecting user data and sending it over existing WebSocket connections in the browser. It ensures required data values are defined to prevent errors during operation.
Features

    WebSocket Monitoring: Overrides the WebSocket constructor to intercept and monitor WebSocket connections in real-time.
    Data Manipulation: Modifies critical data points (bD.dO.data[105], bD.dO.data[106], bD.dO.data[116], bD.dO.data[117]) necessary for the operation of the script.
    Error Handling: Injects default or dummy values if required data fields are not defined to prevent TypeError and ensure smooth execution.

Installation

To use this script:

    Install a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey for your browser.
    Copy the script into a new userscript.
    Save and enable the userscript in your userscript manager.

Usage

Once installed and enabled, the script will run periodically to manipulate ELO values. It monitors WebSocket connections and injects necessary data to achieve the desired effect.
How It Works

The script periodically checks for the existence and correctness of critical data fields (bD.dO.data[105], bD.dO.data[106]) and injects default values if they are missing. It then manipulates other data (bD.dO.data[116], bD.dO.data[117]) and sends the manipulated data over WebSocket connections to update ELO values.

This script is for educational purposes and demonstrates how vulnerabilities can be exploited. Use responsibly and only on systems you have permission to test.
